# DRIVER-DROWSINESS-DETECTION-SYSTEM
##  PROBLEM STATEMENT
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System tackles the serious issue of fatigue-related road accidents by alerting drivers when signs of drowsiness are detected. Drowsy driving leads to slower reaction times and impaired judgment, increasing the risk of collisions and fatalities. These accidents not only cause emotional and physical harm but also result in economic and legal consequences. The system helps enhance road safety by preventing such incidents before they occur.

## OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION 
 Our invention aims to enhance road safety by detecting and alerting drivers to signs of drowsiness using an innovative eyewear-based system. By integrating eyeblink sensors into spectacles or sunglasses, it discreetly monitors alertness in real time and provides timely warnings to prevent accidents. Designed for comfort, affordability, and accessibility, the system empowers drivers to recognize fatigue early and take necessary precautions ultimately helping to reduce drowsy driving incidents and save lives.

## EXPLANATION
  The Driver Drowsiness Detection System tackles the serious problem of fatigue-related driving, a leading cause of road accidents. By utilizing sensors to monitor indicators like prolonged eye closure and subtle head movements that suggest sleepiness, the system can issue timely alerts to prevent potential collisions.
A vibration module positioned near the ear delivers immediate and focused feedback, effectively waking the driver without disturbing passengers or nearby driver an efficient use of tactile stimulation to regain attention.
Integrating the system into eyewear such as spectacles makes it both practical and widely accessible, regardless of the vehicle type or driving environment. This user-friendly design encourages broad usage and plays a crucial role in reducing fatigue-induced accidents, thereby enhancing overall road safety.
